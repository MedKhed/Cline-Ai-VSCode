# MCP Servers Deployment Project

This project tracks the implementation, configuration, and testing of various Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers for use with VSCode and Claude AI integration.

## Project Overview

Model Context Protocol servers provide extended capabilities to AI assistants like Claude, enabling them to interact with external systems, APIs, and services. This project documents our journey in setting up various MCP servers and demonstrating their capabilities.

## Tasks

### 1. GitHub MCP Server ([Issue #1](https://github.com/MedKhed/Cline-Ai-VSCode/issues/1))

**Status:** Open

**Description:** Installation and configuration of the GitHub MCP server to enable repository management, file operations, issue tracking, and more through the Model Context Protocol.

**Achievements:**
- Created a dedicated MCP server directory structure
- Cloned the official servers repository
- Built the GitHub server from source
- Configured the server with proper credentials
- Tested functionality through various operations
- Created this repository and documentation

**Technical Details:**
- Server location: `C:\Users\user\Documents\Cline\MCP\github-server`
- Configuration file: `cline_mcp_settings.json`
- Server name: `github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/github`

## Future Tasks

- Weather API MCP Server implementation
- Perplexity API integration via MCP
- Database connectors through MCP
- Authentication security best practices

## Project Goals

1. Create a comprehensive library of working MCP servers
2. Document installation and configuration procedures
3. Demonstrate practical use cases for AI-powered development
4. Share best practices for secure API integrations
